✓ Result: All objects arranged

🤖 Assistant: Grid arrangement complete:
   ○  ○  [0.18, -0.04] [0.18, 0.04]
   ○  ○  [0.26, -0.04] [0.26, 0.04]
```

---

### Error Recovery

```
You: Try to pick the 'diamond'. If not found, pick any object instead.

✓ Result: No object with label 'diamond' found

🔧 Calling tool: speak("Diamond not found. Picking alternative object.")
✓ Result: Speaking...

🔧 Calling tool: get_detected_objects
✓ Result: Found 3 objects

🔧 Calling tool: pick_object("pencil", [0.15, -0.05])
✓ Result: Picked pencil as alternative

🤖 Assistant: I couldn't find a diamond, so I picked up the
   pencil instead as an alternative.
```

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Batch Processing

```
You: Move all small objects (< 20 cm²) to the left side

🔧 Calling tool: get_detected_objects
✓ Result: Found 4 objects

🤖 Assistant: Filtering objects under 20 cm²...
   Found 2 small objects: pen (16.8 cm²), pencil (18 cm²)

🔧 Calling tool: pick_place_object (pen)
   → Target: [0.18, -0.06]
✓ Result: Placed

🔧 Calling tool: pick_place_object (pencil)
   → Target: [0.18, -0.01]
✓ Result: Placed

🔧 Calling tool: speak("Moved 2 small objects to the left")
✓ Result: Speaking...

🤖 Assistant: Done! Moved 2 small objects to the left side:
   - Pen: [0.18, -0.06]
   - Pencil: [0.18, -0.01]
```

---

### Push Operations

```
You: If the object is too large to pick, push it instead

🔧 Calling tool: get_largest_detected_object
✓ Result: Large box at [0.25, 0.05], width: 8cm

🤖 Assistant: Object width (8cm) exceeds gripper limit (5cm).
   Using push operation...

🔧 Calling tool: speak("Object too large to grip. Using push.")
✓ Result: Speaking...

🔧 Calling tool: push_object
   Arguments: {
     "object_name": "large box",
     "push_coordinate": [0.25, 0.05],
     "direction": "right",
     "distance": 50.0
   }
✓ Result: Pushed 50mm to the right

🤖 Assistant: Successfully pushed the large box 5cm to the right.
   New position: [0.25, 0.0]
```

---

### Dynamic Workspace Adaptation

```
You: Organize workspace: densely packed objects to right,
     spread out objects to left

🔧 Calling tool: get_detected_objects
✓ Result: Found 5 objects

🤖 Assistant: Analyzing object density...
   - Dense cluster (3 objects): right side
   - Sparse objects (2 objects): left side

🔧 Calling tool: pick_place_object (3 times for dense)
   → Right positions: [0.28, -0.08], [0.28, -0.04], [0.28, 0.0]
✓ Result: Dense objects positioned

🔧 Calling tool: pick_place_object (2 times for sparse)
   → Left positions: [0.18, -0.02], [0.18, 0.06]
✓ Result: Sparse objects positioned

🤖 Assistant: Workspace organized:
   - Left (sparse): 2 objects with 8cm spacing
   - Right (dense): 3 objects with 4cm spacing
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Always Detect Before Manipulating

```
✅ Good:
You: What objects do you see?
     [Wait for response]
You: Pick up the pencil

🔧 Uses fresh coordinates from detection

❌ Bad:
You: Pick up the pencil at [0.15, -0.05]

⚠️  Coordinates might be stale if object moved
```

---

### 2. Use Exact Label Matching

```
✅ Good:
🔧 get_detected_objects
✓ Result: Found "pencil" (lowercase)

🔧 pick_object("pencil", ...)  ← Exact match

❌ Bad:
🔧 pick_object("Pencil", ...)  ← Wrong case
🔧 pick_object("pen", ...)     ← Wrong object
```

---

### 3. Check for Success

```
✅ Good:
You: Pick up the pencil
     [Wait for confirmation]
You: Did that work?

🔧 Calling tool: get_detected_objects(label="pencil")
✓ Result: Pencil position changed ← Success!

❌ Bad:
You: Pick up pencil. Move cube. Stack items.
     [No verification between steps]
```

---

### 4. Use Safe Placement

```
✅ Good:
You: Place object in a safe location

🔧 get_largest_free_space_with_center
✓ Result: area=0.0045 m², center=[0.24, -0.03]

🔧 place_object([0.24, -0.03], None)
✓ Result: No collisions

❌ Risky:
You: Place object at [0.25, 0.0]

⚠️  Might collide with existing objects
```

---

### 5. Provide User Feedback

```
✅ Good:
🔧 speak("Scanning workspace...")
🔧 get_detected_objects
🔧 speak("Found 3 objects")
🔧 pick_place_object
🔧 speak("Task completed successfully")

❌ Bad:
🔧 get_detected_objects
🔧 pick_place_object
[Silent operation, user uncertain]
```

---

### 6. Handle Workspace Bounds

```
✅ Good:
🔧 get_workspace_coordinate_from_point("niryo_ws", "upper left")
✓ Result: [0.337, 0.087] ← Valid bounds

🔧 Ensure target within: X=[0.163, 0.337], Y=[-0.087, 0.087]

❌ Bad:
🔧 place_object([0.50, 0.20], None)
✗ Error: Coordinates out of workspace bounds
```

---

### 7. Use Relative Placement

```
✅ Good - Adaptive:
🔧 pick_place_object(
     ...,
     place_coordinate=[0.22, 0.10],
     location="right next to"
   )
✓ Robot calculates exact position with safe spacing

❌ Less Flexible - Manual:
target_y = 0.10 - 0.04  # Manual offset
🔧 pick_place_object(..., [0.22, 0.06], None)
⚠️  Fixed spacing might not be optimal
```
